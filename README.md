# Advent of Code
My solutions to advent of code.

## 2022
After learning some Rust during summer 2023, I through I'd improve my skills by participating in advent of code.
Then I realised that I don't remember much of [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/), so why not prepare by doing last year's puzzles.
Expect mediocre solutions while I learn!
